# ExampleViewJS

Examplary setup for using a JavaScript library like [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) with ManiVault. Other libraries, like e.g. [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite), can be used in the same fashion.

We build a [radar chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) using [radar-chart.js](https://github.com/alangrafu/radar-chart-d3) by Alvaro Graves.

## First look...
Load the Example View JS and drag the newly generated ExampleViewJSData into the view:

After opening the same data in another view, e.g. a parallel coordinates plot, selections in the radar chart are linked to it:
